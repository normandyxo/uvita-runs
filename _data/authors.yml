    I am a 26 year old runner, currently training for my second half marathon.

    Last year, I challenged myself to complete a half marathon for the first
    time. I followed Hal Higdon's Novice plan and completed the Wild Horse Half
    Marathon in Chula Vista, CA. It was a hot day and a difficult race but it
    taught me that with enough preparation and dedication I can accomplish
    almost anything. This year, completed the Yosemite Half Marathon in May.

    I work as a software engineer in Southern California. During my free time I
    like to lift weights, play video games, hike, and watch basketcall
    (Go Lakers!). I also enjoy looking at pictures of cute animals on the
    internet.

    Someday, I'd like to conquer all 26.2 miles of a marathon; I'll settle for a half for now.
