Good goals should be realistic, measurable, and with a timeline. This page outlines my fitness goals for the first half of 2019 (roughly) categorized by sport. I will update their status as I meet them. Hopefully, having these goals written out to the world will help me stay focused and motivated.

The first half of 2019 will be dedicated to getting back to running long distances after almost a year off. I will add new goals for the end of 2019 once I asses my progress during the first half of the year.

## June Goals

##### Running
------
Getting back to running will be most difficult activity to get back to since I will lose much of my conditioning and because it puts the ankle under a lot of pressure. Because of this, I have given myself two "easy" milestones. I anticipate that hitting the running trail will take 3 - 5 months.

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Participate in a 5k

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Reach 20 MPW (following the 10% rule)


##### Lifting
------
Weight lifting has been a hobby of mine since I ran track in high school. My goal for this milestone is to be consistent enough at lifting to finally use the big plates for the squat and deadlift. Increasing my bench to triple digits is also a goal.

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Squat 135lbs

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Deadlift 135lbs

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Bench 100lbs


##### Climbing
------
I am sticking to top rope only for this first milestone. As of January 5th, 2019, I have attempted to climb a few 5.10c routes and completed about half of them. I haven't yet flashed a 5.10c, but I can flash 5.10a routs consistently. For the first milestone, I want to flash a 5.10c and attempt a 5.10d.
