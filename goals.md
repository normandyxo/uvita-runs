Good goals should be realistic, measurable, and with a timeline. This page outlines my fitness goals for 2018 (roughly) categorized by sport. I will update their status as I meet them. Hopefully, having these goals written out to the world will help me stay focused and motivated.

2018 will be mostly dedicated to recovering from an [ankle fracture](/2018/01/05/2018-back-to-basics/). In my opinion, recovery is not achieved when the bone fragments fuse together. Recovery is achieved when I return to a comparable level of activity as I had before the injury.

#### Running
------
Getting back to running will be most difficult activity to get back to since I will lose much of my conditioning and because it puts the ankle under a lot of pressure. Because of this, I have given myself two "easy" milestones. I anticipate that hitting the running trail will take 3 - 5 months.

***Bonus:***

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Average 20mpw for 3 months.

#### Lifting
------
Weight lifting has been a hobby of mine since I ran track in high school. My goal for this year is to be consistent enough at lifting to finally use the big plates for the squat and deadlift. Increasing my bench to triple digits is also a goal.

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Squat 135lbs

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Deadlift 135lbs

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Bench 100lbs

#### Climbing
------
The fall I took while bouldering reinstated my fear of heights, but did not kill my desire to climb. As a compromise, I will only do top rope climbing while I recover mentally. Before the injury, I flashed a short 5.10b. I have given myself the easy milestone to complete a 5.9 before moving onto 5.10s. In order for the goal to be met, the route must be completed without weighing the rope.

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Climb 5.9 route

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Climb 5.10a route

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Climb 5.10b route

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Climb 5.10c route

***Bonus:***

<i class="material-icons md-18 inline">check_box_outline_blank</i> Attempt a 5.11a route.

#### Body weight
------
Before the injury, I weighed 148lbs which is considered overweight for my height. At the time I was working on getting my weight back to a healthy level. For now, I am putting that goal on pause to focus on healing my leg. Once I am capable of walking, I will weigh myself and set a realistic goal.
