First day of actual running! Usually I take 3 miles for granted, but today I was a bit cautious since it was my first run in nearly two weeks. I felt surprisingly good during today’s run. I stuck to a comfortable pace, a bit slower than 12:00 min/mi. The average pace was 11:39 min/mi. Looking back on it the pace seems very slow, but I’m happy with it because I do not want to over train. I can worry about speed much later.

Overall the run was fun and relaxing, but my left hip did flare up a bit after mile 2. It may be a little sore from yesterday’s Myrtle Routine. I will keep an eye on it.
