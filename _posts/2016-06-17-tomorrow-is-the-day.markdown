I'm sitting inside a hotel room in Chula Vista less than twelve hours to go before my first half marathon. I have many regrets, the main one being signing up for this thing, but I also have confidence that I will finish the run. I'm sorry for not updating the blog for the past few weeks. The 9 and 10 mile long runs have taught me a lot.

I hope to report back tomorrow!
