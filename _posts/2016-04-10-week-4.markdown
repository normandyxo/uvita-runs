My knees hate running. I'm sorry knees, I love running.

Well this week has been a rollercoaster. Tuesday my knees were fine during an easy 3.5 mile run. Wednesday they hated the 2 mile run. Thursday they were fine until mile 2 of the 3.5 mile run. Every day I have iced at least once.

I don't want to return to my injured state again. I can feel it creeping back. My knees are starting to flare up when I'm resting, not just during a run or immediately after a run. I'm not ready to give up on my half marathon goal.

Luckily for me I got some time. I'm almost done with Week 4 of the program (only the 5 mile long run left), but I have 10 weeks until the race. That means I have two weeks to spare. I've decided to take an easy week before I continue onto Week 5.

During the easy week, I will run 2 - 3 miles every other day, and do some PT inspired exercises for my knees every day. After this easy week, I'll hopefully continue onto Week 5. If my knees do not recover enough for Week 5, I'm not sure what I would do. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.
