An easy 2 mile run, or so I thought. My legs felt fine, but my abdomen and lower back did not. I had a terrible cramp at mile 1. I’m pretty sure there’s a causal relationship. Last night I had a very rich, cheesy pasta and well, there was a lot of pressure built up in my belly. The discomfort in my abdomen made me subconsciously alter my posture, which in turn flared up my lower back. Needless to say, as soon as I got home I ran to the toilet.

The cheesy pasta was still worth it.
