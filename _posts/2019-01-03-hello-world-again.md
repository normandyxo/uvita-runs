  It's been one year post-op and I'm ready to run again.

It’s been a year since I had surgery to repair a fractured ankle. I’m still alive and I still want to maintain this blog. I know that I made no effort to maintain this blog while I was recovering. My feeble excuse is that I did not feel like it. I do want to write more though. I find it therapeutic to write about accomplishments and failures.

###### 2018 Summary

Since my last post in March, I have nearly returned to my pre-injury level of activity. I can now hike, run, bike, lift weights, swim and rock climb (although I am staying away from bouldering for now).

The visit to the ER, surgery, and follow up appointments ran out my out of pocket deductible quickly. By the time I was cleared to start physical therapy in April, I had to pay almost nothing out of pocket. I capitalized on this by treating physical therapy and recovery as my second job. I had a session twice a week for nearly four months and I tacked on a session on my own once a week.

To build some sort of cardio base, I took swimming lessons at a YMCA. From April to November,  I swam two to three times a week. I hated swimming at first. Every 25 yard length left me gasping for air. By November, I was swimming 900 yard workouts with relative ease. Although I learned to appreciate swimming, I saw it only as a means to my goal of eventually returning to running.

I started out with very short intervals on the treadmill. Jog for 15 seconds, walk for 30 seconds, repeat 5 times. I gradually increased the running time based on how my legs felt. Once I hit the 2 minute run time, I knew I was ready to head outside.

I decided to go back to basics and re-run the Couch to 5k (C25k) program. I am one run away from completing week 6 of the program. My ankle feels sore afterwards, but not enough to cause concern. If everything goes to plan, I’ll be done with the program in early February.

###### 2019 Plan

The plan for this year is to continue building on what I got so far with two themes to keep in mind:

####### Patience

Everything takes time. Building endurance and strength takes time. Recovering from an injury takes time.

I think the majority of injuries I’ve suffered were caused by impatience. A common piece of running advice is the 10% rule (only increase weekly mileage by 10%). I’ve read it and heard it hundreds of times and yet I’ve never followed it. This year, I plan to spend at least the first half of the year building a base within the constraints of the 10% rule. If I stick to the 10% rule, hopefully I will spend less time recovering and more time training.

####### YOLO STCOY
You only live once so take care of yourself.

My father always says “Nothing is the same after an injury.” I never believed him until this past year. Yes, I am back to being active since the surgery, but my ankle still gets sore and swollen, and I lost about 5° of ankle dorsiflexion. That injury was an accident. It is now clear to me that I must do everything I can to avoid preventable injuries.

That means taking the time to heal and recover when needed. It also means doing pre-emptive things like foam rolling, stretching, getting enough sleep, and not eating junk all the time.

With those two themes in mind, I present my running goals for 2019.

###### June Running Goals
Complete C25k
Participate in a 5k
Reach 20 MPW (following the 10% rule)

###### Year end goals

No idea yet! I want to evaluate in June and set realistic goals. It would be awesome if I could put in “Half marathon” here, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself. I’m staying focused on the June goals, and think about end of year goals later.
