One of my favorite indulgences is boba. I love the stuff. However since it's so sugary, Ben and I have an agreement to only have it once per week as a reward for eating healthy. This week, as motivation for the short crosstrain session, we rode our bikes to a nearby boba shop.

Ben is a way more hardcore cyclist than me, so I'm sure my weak 11mph was too slow for him. Next week we'll bike a little longer and of course get some boba.
