###### Knee Recovery Week was not a bust!

I just ran four miles with minimal knee pain. There was a little bit of discomfort during the last half mile, but I think it was because I let my stride grow too long so that my foot was landing way in front of me.

I monitored my knee pain carefully during the run. Every mile I checked in with my knees and every mile they felt good. I'm so happy I could kiss my ice pack and foam roller!

Still, I'm really looking forward to a day off tomorrow. A day off from training that is, I still have to work tomorrow.
