Knee Recovery Week turned into Overall Recovery Week. Saturday morning, I rolled over my shoulder to silence my alarm and the world started to spin. Any movement of my head triggered the same reaction. A visit to the doctor on Sunday confirmed that it was vertigo.

I improved slowly over the week, but it was still bad enough that I did not trust myself to drive or run. Instead I tried my best to strengthen my legs while maintaining my head as still as possible. I also iced every my knees at least once a day.

It's now Sunday, the last day of the recovery week, and I feel pretty good. No current pain on my knees. I'm glad vertigo came along and forced me to sit out. It may have been a blessing in disguise.
