I have four weeks until Yosemite. I didn't realize that it was so close until I got an email from the race organizer with race information.

Last week, I attended an out of state conference. I was only able to work out two times during that week. I have to admit that I could have probably done better, but my will power requires more work. I was nervous coming Week 10's 5 mile run, but I was pleasantly surprised. Taking a whole week off did not kill my cardiovascular endurance. In fact, I was able to push my pace and finish faster than previous weeks.

Since I only have four weeks left, I've decided to meticulously plan my schedule. Specifically, I want to add a bit more cardio during these last three weeks and emphasize foam rolling. The last week will be an easy taper week.

###### Week 10
* **Monday:** Rest
* **Tuesday:** Strength + foam roll + 30 minute easy cardio.
* **Wednesday:** 5 mile run
* **Thursday:** Strength + foam roll + 30 minute easy cardio.
* **Friday:** 5 mile run
* **Saturday:** Strength + foam roll + 30 minute easy cardio.
* **Sunday:** 9 mile run

###### Week 11
* **Monday:** Rest
* **Tuesday:** Strength + foam roll + 30 minute easy cardio.
* **Wednesday:** 5 mile run
* **Thursday:** Strength + foam roll + 30 minute easy cardio.

###### Week 14 - Taper + Race week
> I will eliminate all strength sessions this week to make sure my legs are fresh.

* **Wednesday:** Foam roll + easy walk?

In non related (nerd) news, I'm looking into moving this blog to a Jekyll static site. If I decide to take on this work, I hope to have it done before the race.
