I finally did it. I signed up for a half marathon.

I was on my way back from the gym last Saturday when I saw a bus with an ad for Run Rock n' Roll San Diego. I stared at it while waiting for the traffic light to change to green. One of my New Year's resolutions is to run more. I've always wanted to tackle a long distance (usually I run 5ks).

Once I got home, I did some online investigating on running plans. I had to make sure that preparing myself for a half marathon would be feasible. I run regularly (3 to 4 times a week). I was happy to find Hal Higdon's (beginner training plan)[http://halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program]. I had just enough time to train for Run Rock n' Roll, but I decided to be cautious and stretch the plan two more weeks so I signed up for the [Wild Horse Trail Half Marathon](http://www.halfmarathons.net/california-wild-horse-trail-half-marathon-10k/) in Chula Vista, CA.

I will use this blog to document my journey to 13.1 miles. I look forward to the adventure!
