So I ran five miles today for the first time in a month. I was a bit worried about my knees so I dug through my closet until I found my old and trusty knee brace. It was a great run; the weather was nice and my knee was fine. Although I did take some ibuprofen in the morning to alleviate my monthly cramps. We'll see how I feel next time I run.

I did cheat for like 30 seconds at the turnaround point for the 5 mile run to get this picture:
