###### Saturday Crosstrain
Ben and I went hiking at [Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park](http://ocparks.com/parks/ronald/) on Saturday. The day was overcast. We took a short 4 mile loop through the park. I took this as an opportunity to get some practice with my new camera. Being an n00b, a lot of my shots were bad. The highlight of the hike was seeing a group of four or five coyote pups playing around. I tried to snap a picture of them, but I was shooting in manual mode and before I could adjust any setting, the pups disappeared into the bushes.


###### Sunday 8 mile gauntlet
Sunday was a very busy day for me. I ran 8 miles, went grocery shopping, cleaned the apartment and got new running shoes (finally!).

I survived the 8 mile run. The first mile was a bit uncomfortable. I think I need to stretch a bit more before I run. Miles 2 through 6 were fine; I felt focused and light. Miles 7 and 8 were the worst. Just before mile 7, my groin started to complain. I haven't really focused on stretching the groin area, I think it's time I do.
