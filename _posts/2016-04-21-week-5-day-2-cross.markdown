I've decided to replace the recovery short runs on Wednesdays with a cycling session. I still get my legs moving and my heart pumping, but my knees are spared from a beating.

Ben was excited to join me on my Wednesday bike sessions. This time he let me set the pace for our 40 minute ride. I pushed myself so that it was not too easy. Our boba rides are usually a leisurely 10mph so I pushed our pace to 12mph. I was surprised to learn that Ben thought the pace was still too easy. I guess I need to bike more.
