This Monday, I completed the last workout of Couch to 5k. I’ve been running at such a slow pace that the actual run was 2.4 miles long. Regardless, I can check off “Complete Couch to 5k” off the June goals list! This is the first milestone in what I hope will be a good running year.

The next step is to build a solid running base. During this time, I will slowly increase my mileage to 10 MPW and the running days from three to four.

To keep myself motivated and accountable, I’ve signed up for a local 5k in March. By the time the 5k comes around, I will have 13 weeks of running. I don’t expect the 5k to be my fastest. It will be a good baseline test for a first "tempo" run.

To make sure I adhere to the 10% rule, I have a spreadsheet that calculates my daily mileage. Below is what the plan looks like for the next month.

* Week 0: 3 x 2.2 mi (6.6 miles total) ← This week
* Week 1: 3 x 2.4 mi (7.2 mi total)
* Week 2: 3 x 2.6 mi (7.8 mi total)
* Week 3: 3 x 2.8 mi (8.5 mi total)
* Week 4: 3 x 3.1 mi (9.4 mi total) ← 5k here

Tomorrow will be my first run in the base building period. I can't wait!
