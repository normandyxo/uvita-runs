I only got 6 hours of sleep last night. Waking up early to get my run in was difficult. It's only the first long ten minutes that are the worst. Once I was out on the trail I felt much better.

Today's run was easy. The discomfort I experienced on the last 3 miler did not reappear. It's only the tail end of the first week and I'm already looking forward to a glorious day off tomorrow.
