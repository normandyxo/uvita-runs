First long run! Ok not that long, but I felt very accomplished once I completed it.

I visited my parents' today and returned to the trail I used to run on when I was in high school. I felt good overall. I tried hard to to exert myself too much so my pace was quite slow (almost 12:00min/mi). I did notice some discomfort on my right knee. I think it is a combination of the hilly run (the trail I've been running on for the past few months is quite flat) and the lack of proper focused strength training for nearly three weeks. I really need to hammer down the strength training plan soon.
