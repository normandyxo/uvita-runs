It's been a while since I've updated the blog. I have still stuck to the training program (more or less) and have completed Week 7 successfully.

###### Week 6 Recap
I decided to skip the 5k race recommended for this week since I skipped the 5 mile run from the week before. Instead of the 5k, I ran 6 miles. I slept in that morning and headed out for the run at 10 am. For the first time in a long time, I had a small breakfast before the run. It was not a typical breakfast, or a very healthy one, but it was filled with carbs and protein. I had a pair of [Justin's Peanut Butter Cups](http://shop.justins.com/Dark-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cups/p/JNB-000254&c=Justins@PeanutButterCups). My work has these available every now and then as snacks and I love them. Having some food in my stomach really made a difference during the 6 mile run.

This has gotten me thinking about fueling during long runs. The distance will soon increase beyond 7 miles, and the race is 13.1 miles. I need to start doing some research into how to fuel during the race. I've heard of "Gu" packets, but I don't know much about them besides their name.

###### Week 7 Recap
I was in Salt Lake City most of the week for a conference. The days were very busy so I found fitting my workouts into the schedule challenging. During the week, I ran 4.5 miles on one day and biked for an hour on another day. The days where I did not workout had enough walking that I figured I would be ok.

To avoid being tired on Mother's Day, I moved the long run to the day before (Saturday). Unfortunately, I did not have any more peanut butter cups, so I ran the seven miles on a cup of coffee. The run felt good. There was a bit of knee pain on mile 3, but it calmed down by mile 4. The rest of the run was fine.

On my way back, I almost stepped on a tiny lizard. He was too comfortable in the sun to run away from my phone.

It was a good idea to get the long run over with on Saturday since afterwards I went to a beer and music festival with friends and I drank all the calories I spent on the run. Guiltless drinking is another great benefit of long distance running.

###### Looking forward
Strava has now sent me two emails telling me that I need new shoes and I cannot agree more. I'm hoping to do some research throughout the week and make a purchase next weekend.

After a year of use, the velcro of my knee brace is starting to give out. During one of the 4 mile runs of Week 6, I had to stop twice to readjust the straps. I think it's time for a new one.
