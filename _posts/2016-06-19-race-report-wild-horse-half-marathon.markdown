I did it!


##### Race Information
* [Wild Horse Half Marathon](http://www.dirtdevilracing.com/2016-racing-schedule/2016-wild-horse-trail-half-marathon/)
* Half marathon
* June 18th, 2016

##### Goals
* **Goal 1**: Survive - complete!
* **Goal 2**: Finish with a time close to 2hrs 40mins (~12:00min/mi pace) - not complete :(

##### Training
I have been following Hal Higdon's half marathon novice 1 program.

I took a week off due to illness, and repeated two weeks. All in all, it was 13 weeks of training. Before the race, the longest distance I'd run was 10 miles.

##### Pre-race
I live in Orange County and the race was in San Diego on a Saturday at 7 am so I drove down to San Diego Friday evening. Ben and I found a good taco place near the hotel were staying at. The al pastor tacos at "Tacos el Gordo" were amazing. I had four of them! We went to be fairly early, but I was unable to get a good sleep; I was very anxious.

The next morning, we left the hotel at 6:00am. I used the link provided by the race organizer's site. Once we got there we realized we were in the wrong place! The site had a link to coordinates that opened in the Google Maps app. Unfortunately, we were routed down a construction road. I went to the site again and found a plain text address. We raced back on the construction road and made it to the race site with 10 minutes to spare.

I had some Justin's peanut butter cups and prayed to the chocolate and running gods for a good race.

##### First 10 miles
The furthest I had ever run before this race was 10 miles. During this race, I did not make it to 10 miles without stopping.

Having trained in a paved and flat trail, I struggled with the nagging tiny hills on the race trail. The race took place on the start of a heat wave; the temperature peaked in the 80s during the race. Although I drank water from my bottles, and stopped at every station, I still felt very dehydrated. I felt the beginnings of a calf cramp at mile 7 and had to stop and stretch my leg. I walked for about half a mile. At that time, I did find myself questioning whether or not I could finish it. Without looking at my watch, I knew I was already way below my target pace.

I did have the sudden urge to go to the bathroom on mile 9. Luckily, there was a lonely porta-potty. Maybe the tacos were not such a great idea.

It was increasingly difficult not to check my watch and phone to see how much distance was left. I was afraid that seeing the distance I had left to cover, or my slow pace would demoralize me.

##### Last 3.1 miles
The last aid station gave me the energy I needed to continue. The staff was very encouraging and they cheered for the runners as they stopped for water.
"Just a 5k left," they said. After I left the aid station, I repeated those words to myself in my head. A 5k; that's an easy day's run! I caught up with a group of ladies going at around my pace and decided to stay with them.

I have never been more happy to see the word "FINISH" before. I pushed myself to finish strong and completed the race in 2:51:02.

I got a cool pint glass, which I promptly filled with water instead of beer.

#### Looking ahead
Although I did not meet my time goal, I'm still very happy with having finished the race. It was very difficult and I believe it made me stronger. I have earned a whole new level of respect for marathoners. After all, I struggled to complete half of what many people run in 4 hours or less!

I have a 5k for July 4th. I will most likely take a few days off to recover and then run 12 miles or so a week until the 5k.

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Consider the terrain the race will be on when you train.** I wish I had added more trail runs to my workouts, instead of only running on a paved trail.
2. **Hydrate.** This one seems obvious, but I think that my calf cramp could have been avoided if I had done a better job of hydrating the day of the race. I drank plenty of water the day before, but
3. **Carry some TP during a race.** I was lucky that the lone porta-potty I encountered had a roll of TP. I hate to think what would have happened if it did not!
4. **Stay with it.** While I was struggling with a calf cramp, it was easy to question whether or not I could finish the race. Looking back, that seems silly. Of course I could finish the race, I had been training for it for the past three months.
