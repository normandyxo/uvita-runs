I'm following the format used for race reports in [r/running](https://reddit.com/r/running).


##### Race Information
* [Anaheim Semper Fi 5k and 10k](http://www.semper5k.org/)
* 10k race
* May 21st, 2016

##### Goals
Originally I wanted to finish with a 10:00 min/mile pace, however due to a cold, I lowered my goal to finishing with a 12:00 min/mile pace.

* **Goal 1**: Survive - complete!
* **Goal 2**: Finish with a time under 1:15:00 - complete!

##### Training
I have been following Hal Higdon's half marathon novice 1 program.

##### Pre-race
I went to be a bit late last night and was unable to get good sleep due to pre-race jitters. I always get nervous about races, and this one made me specially nervous because of a flu.

The day of the race, I woke up at 6:00 am and took some cold medicine to help with the sore throat. I got dressed and drove to the race site. On my way there I ate two peanut butter cups. They tasted weird because of the cold syrup I'd had earlier.

At the race site, I paced around nervously and stretched my legs. My warmup is usually 5 minutes of walking and stretching and I did not want to change my routine. The race organizers divided the runners into groups based on average pace. I joined the 11:00-12:00 min/mile group.

##### First 5k
My strategy going into the race was to split the race into two 5ks and shoot for a negative split. I listened to [Remember the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvr08sCPOc) at the starting line to get fired up and then switched to the Muse radio station on Spotify.

Right away, I realized I made a mistake by joining the 11:00-12:00 min/mile group as I was passing a lot of people. This got me worried that my pace was too fast, but my legs felt good and I was not out of breath.

The course was flat and the day was cool. My knees were fine, the did not bother me. I thought I was doing fine until I passed the fork where the 5k ended. I quickly checked my phone for pace information and saw that I was beating my goal pace; I had completed the first half of the course with an average of 10:30 min/mile!

##### Second 5k
Two thoughts collided in my mind when I saw my time after the first 5k. First: What the heck, I am doing a lot better than expected. Second: I'm obly half way done; I have to run another 3.1 miles and try to get a negative split.

The second half of the course was much more challenging. It was still flat, but I started to really feel tired.  Somehow, the peanut butter cups smiled upon me and I was able to truck along. The course was a straight out and back, and I could not see far enough to where the turn around was. The crowd of runners had thinned out on the course. I saw a runner in the distance carrying an American flag. I made it my goal to catch him. Eventually I did.

With half a mile to go, I chugged one of the water cups handed to me by a guy that complimented my Lego Batman shirt and opened my stride. The course finished on a slight downhill; it felt good to let gravity do most of the work.

I finished the race with a time of 1:01:56.7.

##### Post race
Overall, it was a day of accomplishments:

* Beat a cold (hah!)
* PR on 10k (First race is a guaranteed PR, but it still counts).
* First place in age group (Females 20-24).

To celebrate, I went straight to my favorite donut hsop and got myself a Nutella Cronut. It is a donut made of croissant dough with nutella between some of the layers and nutella frosting on top. It is so thick, that I used utensils to eat it.

##### What's next
I'm still on schedule to complete my first half marathon in June. I had a great experience running my first 10k and I look forward to running one again after the half marathon.
