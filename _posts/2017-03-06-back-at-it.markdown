My last post was over half a year ago, so here's a quick catch up.

After the Wild Horse Half, I took some time off from running. I didn't have much of a post half plan except to run a local 5k. I did run the 5k but after that my running habits slowly came undone. I felt confident that after running a half, I could maintain a base level of fitness with relative ease. And so my weekly mileage kept lowering and lowering until I was running less than 10 miles a week.

Last December, I was looking for motivation to run when I came across the [Yosemite Half Marathon](yosemitehalfmarathon.com). I've never been to Yosemite, so I figured this was a good opportunity as ever and I signed up. The race is at Bass Lake on May 13th.

I spent four weeks running the novice 10k training plan from Hal Higdon. After that, I jumped into the half training plan. I'm currently on week 6 of training. Those four weeks of base training were a harsh reminded of how much conditioning I have lost. This experience has shown me that I need goals to fuel motivation. I'll make sure I have another goal set by the time May 13th rolls around.
