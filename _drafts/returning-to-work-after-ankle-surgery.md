> Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional. This post just documents my experience in returning to a desk job wearing a cast after ankle surgery. When in doubt, always ask your attending physician.

I am a software engineer which means that my job is spent 70% sitting at my desk, 10% attending meetings, and 10% snacking or socializing. After spending nearly a month off work while recovering from an ankle fracture, I finally made it to work yesterday. I am non weight bearing, and wearing a cast on my left leg which limits my mobility.

Although I was excited to get out and see my coworkers, I felt intimidated and nervous for my first day out. Since the injury, the only outings I'd had were to the orthopedist or the hospital. I had a few days to prepare myself for success. Below is the approach I took to make sure I had a successful and safe day at work.

## Prerequisites
**1. Doctor's all clear**

  Before even considering going back to work, you must get the ok from your attending physician. Depending on your workplace, you may need a return to work note from your doctor.  

**2. Some way to get around**

  Whether it be crutches, a wheelchair, or a knee scooter, some sort of indoor transportation is required if you are non weight bearing. I went with a knee scooter; it's much more comfortable than crutches. Whatever mobility tool you choose, make sure you practice some basic motions. For example, opening and closing doors, sitting down, standing up, going to the bathroom, etc.

## Getting to work
**1. Solo, or getting a ride?**

  Figure out how you're going to get to work. Are you driving yourself? If so,  you need a plan to get your mobility tool into your vehicle before you can drive off.  If someone drives you, they can help you to get from the car to your mobility tool and back as needed. The easiest way of doing this is to have someone drive you, but that doesn't mean you cannot do it on your own.

  Crutches should fit in the front passenger seat of most cars. If you are using crutches, just sit in the driver's seat, and stash the crutches on the passenger seat. Remember that the length of crutches can be adjusted if they are too long to fit in the car.

  If using a knee scooter and self driving, a cane can be an good intermediate tool when getting in and out of the car. A cane will fit in the front seat, but it is cumbersome to move using only one foot. Repeatedly twisting the foot side to side while inching forward was the best way that work for me.

  Below is the method I used when I returned to work. For reference, I drive a small 2001 Toyota Corolla; not the roomiest of cars.

  1. Using the scooter, I opened both of the doors on the driver's side of the car. I kept a cane on the driver's seat. I took it out, and placed it in front of the rear door.
  1. I stood up using the cane for balance and carefully placed the scooter on the back seat. This may take some effort, my scooter weighs 21lbs.
  1. After the scooter is stashed safely, I used the cane and the car itself to slowly inch backwards to close the rear door and then inch forward to the driver's seat. "Inching forward" was a combination of small hops (risky) and the twisting of my good foot to take mini steps.
  1. I sat down on the driver's seat and placed the cane on the front passenger seat. I then closed the door, put on my seatbelt and drove off.

  To get out of of the car:

  1. I opened the driver's door and place the cane outside.
  1. I stood up using the cane for support, and then inched my way to the rear door. I made sure to be past the opening path of the door.
  1. I opened the door and lifted the scooter out of the car and onto the ground. I then put my injured leg on the scooter and backed away enough so that the door could be closed. I then closed the door.
  1. Using the scooter, I rolled to the front door while carrying the cane in one hand. I did this slowly since I only had one hand on the handlebars. I placed the cane on the driver's seat, closed the door, locked my car and rolled away.

**2. Parking**

  You may qualify for a temporary handicap placard because of the injury. To get a temporary placard in California, you and your physician must fill out a form. The form must then be turned in to the DMV along with a small fee. Having the placard is a huge advantage while recovering. Ask your physician for more information.

  Note that the form for the placard can also be turned into AAA if you are a member. I was able to get the placard from AAA the same day I turned in the form.

## During work
**1. Keeping the leg elevated**

**2. Remote into meetings if possible**

**3. Bring your own lunch**

## Heading home
**1. Driving yourself**

  If you drove yourself, try to avoid the rush of people leaving the office. That may mean leaving 15 mins before the usual rush (5:00 pm in my case), or at least 30 mins after. See the section on [getting to work](#getting-to-work) for some advice on getting into the car.

**2. Getting a ride**

  If someone is giving you a ride, determine where you will meet after work before you get dropped off. Getting into the car will take longer than usual, since both you and your mobility tool have to get in the car. Avoid high traffic areas if possible and use the hazard lights if it cannot be avoided.
  If you got a handicap placard, I recommend that the driver keep it and you meet at the handicap parking spots.

## Misc
**1. Have an escape plan**

  Be prepared in case you feel ill, or uncomfortable and need to go home early.

**2. Ask if you can work from home**

  The ability to work from home is something that more and more workplaces are adopting. If you have the opportunity to, it will be a good idea work from home a couple of days a week. If you have a follow appointment with your doctor, I recommend that you work from home that day to minimize the number of trips for that day.
